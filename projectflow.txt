1.Create mycode.py and add code to it.(it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
2. Do a git add- commit - push before initiating dvc
# pip install dvc
3. we do "dvc init"(creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
4. Now do "mkdir S3" (Creates a new S3 directory)
5. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
6. Next "dvc add data/"
    Now it will as to do:("git rm-r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
    Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
7. Again we do "dvc add data/" (Create data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc" .
8. Now "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
9. Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.
10. Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
11. Again - - "dvc commit" and "dvc push"
